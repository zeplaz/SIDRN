###### a multiprupoise simulation engine used to produce a multimeida and widerages art toys or art tools systems that enagie the artist, audnace, particpanes and coders. will be used to make a aetheitc econ-reosuese tatical simualor to, used for live stage showes nartive genreation.keys are sfml, for 2d rendering, opencv for live and post video edting, production and anageiment. a collition syeems, for entites, and other fetures!

#### :FOLDERS: 

##### source
		where current, work can be found and were enegine sorce will live when done!
		there are subfolders there so i will invite you to look at the readme inside!

##### test_modualz
		contains subfolders for bits built
		
		##### |modual_test_labzm.cpp|
		Lamda_to_function&&_curvegenrator_display 
		sfml dispaly of curves genreated by lamdaz

		##### |inpit_pluz_curvetest.cpp|
		curve_genrator_with_usb_contlz_  
		showcases cruve lamdas modifed by usb controls

		##### |input_test_main.cpp|
		verybasic sfml usbjoysicktest

		#####|usb__colourchange_curvv_03.cpp|
			usbcontrolr now chnacges colour aswell

		####|Two Headerfiles USB_controler.h and |curve_sf_dis.h|
			these headers work with these tests, and have been changed
			to some degree or will, in the sorce..and will be numberd from hear on out
			so that this folder can remain simpler to test out the build yourself.
			
		
##### binary_tests
		includez exported binaries of tests along the way

##### Images of tests 
		some screen caps of stages.

##### modelz 
		notes made by hand or starUML for mostly ideas and helping see were there going
		math notes, and other drawings assoated with the vision.. currntly i need
		to recmpess alot of them to smaller size(i scan usally to high res), so more do 		exsit outside of the current git 

##### notez 
		very lose, bits of code, essays or notes i find useful inspring or refental Needs update




as things are just being build. 
the plan is to use modual methods,

i want to add multithreading, and also, get the cv, and sfml coprating effeictly.
next up entity system and cv->sfml sfml-cv. cycle in 44mm use advanst GJK new algthem
for internal sector scans. add bounding box for GUI. add gui.
