######Top LEVEL view to working space of current Projects. _Zepalz {Matthew Edmund Duffy && orgburo} if you'r looking for the core code go right to sym_engine0.01_shirz_/source however i advice you to check out the top level of sym_engine0.01_shirz_/readME.md 


#### |ROOT_DIR;
###### The lose files, are more for intrest. active reserch, or little bits of colour! file stucture as follows


#### :FOLDERS: 

##### sysm_engine0.01_shirz_ ;
		Pramary working folder of current project.
		go to SORCE FOLDER for most uptodate WORK.
		getting OPENCV and USB to genreate graph and multi
		montior syimulatons. and other work.

		work likely current buildsing blocks. engine to run imulations, 
		tools and the image processy system and likely 	
		other model reserch, though things built inside here will be 
		used to construct or aid in the building of
		diffrent symulators, modlers and games.
		..in this folder find subfolder as they are built out, 
	see readME in folder. 
								


##### Image_process parts_ ; 

this folder includes three projects. though in rough state,

		BinarY_imag_anlizer_G. begings work on some binary parts of images.
		inputcolz handles tests in input devices, for event loops.
		Refc_vison current working DIR.for progress on image processing and seg.
		reencnotez has notes and code refs.

		reforcor_image_PMG_PR.. deals with graycale image filters and masks.
		and well as some refacoring of output streamsand inout etc. 
		starts outlineing for further compent and thread support.
		reorz_img has models and images
		
		Refac_vison.. final test incarantion currntly does not compile, but most of the 
		algurthms assoated with building a meanshift image processor, will be ustilized
		

##### cmd_modual_Strat_ ;
	
		here is a game, will live, current just some art and notezprimary work of me 
		and ryan k. includes assets and will use the Sym_enigne "shirz"

//antoher imprant focus needs to be on proper secutry, so, that acess to the cmdline update application, that only has acess to the tulupes of some of the posgree datalines, is complex enogh to allow for simple comcaion and update of grnaual data, but is also not ssutbakle to CPU injections into the arryaies, of touples upon reentry from a comprimised postion, furthenmore proper allocation of the sql cmds, to block ingecions and preprocesing them under proper secutry proticals. 
the secutry log should check. for these rupte.z but mor eintrestling, a cascading effect should be blocked, so the falure of a node, or loss of passpword, in one node of cmd,as well as overasl soruce of the aplciaion, can be comprimised wihout congtagen to other secutries layers useing loczlied data structres for inteprlation of the commcuated data packets.
