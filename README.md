# SIDRN
 (system-ingrgated-data-responce-network)..Orgburoz system for intgreated datafeedz to the agentzprocessinmagecmdprotcalz.

#### |ROOT_DIR;
includes;
The lose files, are more for intrest. active reserch, or little bits of colour! the main file stucture is this.


#### :FOLDERS: 

##### cmd_modual_Strat_ ;
	
	here is a game, will live, current just some art and notezprimary work of me and ryan k. includes assets and uses the Sym_enigne "shirz"

##### sysm_engine0.01shirz_ ;
		Pramary working folder of current stuff, is exported to apprate locations. go to SORCE FOLDER for most uptodate work, 
		engine to run imulations, uncludes tools and the image processy system and likely 			other modual 
		reserch, though things built inside here will be used to construct or aid in the building of
		diffrent symulators, modlers and games.
		{namespace shirz}.. 
		in this folder find subfolder as they are built out, for most recent tests goto sorce, test binarys
		in binary test fodler. see readm me in folder. 
								


##### Image_process parts_ ; 

this folder includes three projects. though in rough state,

		BinarY_imag_anlizer_G. begings work on some binary parts of images.
		inputcolz handles tests in input devices, for event loops.
		Refc_vison current working DIR.for progress on image processing and seg.
		reencnotez has notes and code refs.

		reforcor_image_PMG_PR.. deals with graycale image filters and masks. and well as 
		some refacoring of output streamsand inout etc. 
		starts outlineing for further compent and thread support.
		reorz_img has models and images
		
		Refac_vison.. final test incarantion currntly does not compile, but most of the 
		algurthms assoated with building a meanshift image processor, will be ustilized
		



##### Lamda_to_function&&_curvegenrator_display_ ; 
		sfml dispaly of curves genreated by lamdaz

##### curve_genrator_with_usb_contlz_ ; 
		showcases cruve lamdas modifed by usb controls

//antoher imprant focus needs to be on proper secutry, so, that acess to the cmdline update application, that only has acess to the tulupes of some of the posgree datalines, is complex enogh to allow for simple comcaion and update of grnaual data, but is also not ssutbakle to CPU injections into the arryaies, of touples upon reentry from a comprimised postion, furthenmore proper allocation of the sql cmds, to block ingecions and preprocesing them under proper secutry proticals. 
the secutry log should check. for these rupte.z but mor eintrestling, a cascading effect should be blocked, so the falure of a node, or loss of passpword, in one node of cmd,as well as overasl soruce of the aplciaion, can be comprimised wihout congtagen to other secutries layers useing loczlied data structres for inteprlation of the commcuated data packets.
