MAIN_DIR:.
includes;
BinarY_imag_anlizer_G. begings work on some binary parts of images.
inputcolz handles tests in input devices, for event loops.
Refc_vison current working DIR.for progress on image processing and seg.
reencnotez has notes and code refs.
reforcor_image_PMG_PR.. deals with graycale image filters and masks. and well as some refacoring of output streamsand inout etc. starts outlineing for further compent and thread support.
reorz_img has models and images








system is built with, comcation between a posgresSQL server, and c++ aplcoiations, both a cmd line interface api, as well as a dashbord dispay mechinsime --selcuded-. sgemating compents to privlage level binary compilation, to provent rever-se mechinecode.-- futehr extations should include tools for regulair repsonce feedback, with recursieve analattics,.. and an expation of, emergent stablity in unstable envrometnal systemesz.

//antoher imprant focus needs to be on proper secutry, so, that acess to the cmdline update application, that only has acess to the tulupes of some of the posgree datalines, is complex enogh to allow for simple comcaion and update of grnaual data, but is also not ssutbakle to CPU injections into the arryaies, of touples upon reentry from a comprimised postion, furthenmore proper allocation of the sql cmds, to block ingecions and preprocesing them under proper secutry proticals. 
the secutry log should check. for these rupte.z but mor eintrestling, a cascading effect should be blocked, so the falure of a node, or loss of passpword, in one node of cmd,as well as overasl soruce of the aplciaion, can be comprimised wihout congtagen to other secutries layers useing loczlied data structres for inteprlation of the commcuated data packets.
